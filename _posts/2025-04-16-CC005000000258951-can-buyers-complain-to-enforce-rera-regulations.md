A buyer filed a complaint against the Developer, alleging that the 12 flats he had booked in their project were not shown as sold inventory on the MahaRERA portal.

While the complainant appeared for the hearing, the developer remained absent. However, upon verification, MahaRERA found that the flats were indeed marked as sold in the portal. The complainant then withdrew the complaint, and the matter was closed.

## Learnings from case

### 1. Buyers Have the Right to Complain
MahaRERA is accessible to individual buyers. If you notice non-compliance - whether itâ€™s delayed possession, inaccurate disclosures, or other violations - you can raise a formal complaint.

### 2. Developers Must Keep Inventory Updated
Not updating sold/unsold status or project details can cause confusion and lead to complaints - even if unintentional.
