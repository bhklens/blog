### Lessons

- **The possession date in the registered agreement is legally binding.** Don’t get misled by expected delivery dates in brochures or verbal commitments by sales people.
- **Get it in writing.** Ensure all promises — amenities, possession dates, specifications — are clearly included in the registered Agreement for Sale. Brochures and verbal assurances don’t hold up.
- **Documentation matters.** The buyers lost part of their claim because they didn’t upload the Agreement and submitted poor-quality brochures.
- **Fit-out possession ≠ real possession.** RERA recognizes possession *only* after OC and essential services are in place.
- **You can claim delayed interest even after taking possession.** Taking the keys doesn’t mean you’ve waived your rights.
- **Delayed interest ≠ penalty.** The buyers' demand for ₹25L for amenities and ₹5L for mental agony was rejected. RERA sees delayed interest as fair compensation, not punishment.
