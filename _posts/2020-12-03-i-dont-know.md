I thought voting is just a waste of time. I’m not in the mood right now to write about this kind of stuff but I can say that one vote of yours is really important in changing the system of your community.

The way you vote is not the only thing that I’m referring to, but the main thing here are... who do you vote for, who are your pillars and, your solid state of mind for the person who do you really want to take such political positions.

I don’t have yet any experience in voting, but this upcoming election here in the Philippines, I still don’t know what to do. But I think if I already know who are the candidates for such positions, I’m going to vote those people who are really deserving. 

*I don’t know*.
