States have different voter registration deadlines and requirements. Early registration for young voters starts at the age of 16. But voters can vote at the age of 18. Some schools officiated with the COMELEC offers free early registration for young voters. The will of the people, then, is best expressed in clean, orderly and honest election.


The citizen voters are entitled to free and informed choice on whom to vote and must be dictated by the genuine welfare of the majority. Every individual political choices and decisions made by the citizen voters will determine the kind of government that will serve them.


**Exercise your Right to Vote and Register as Voter!**


### Qualifications and Disqualification of a Voter


All citizens of the Philippines, eighteen years of age or over, and a resident of the Philippines for one year and in the city or municipality wherein he proposes to vote for at least six months immediately preceding the election are qualified to vote.

The following shall be disqualified from voting:

- a. Any person who has been sentenced by final judgment to suffer imprisonment for not less than one year. However, he/ she may reacquire the right to vote upon expiration of five years after service of sentence.

- b. Any person who has been adjudged by final judgment by competent court or tribunal of having committed any crime involving disloyalty to the duly constituted government such as rebellion, sedition, violation of the anti-subversion and firearms laws, or any crime against national security, unless restored to his full civil and political rights in accordance with law: Provided, That he shall regain his right to vote automatically upon expiration of five years after service of sentence.

- c. Insane or incompetent persons as declared by competent authority


In addition, RA 9189 or the Overseas Absentee Voting Law entitles all Filipino citizens overseas, not otherwise disqualified by law, and immigrants and permanent residents with affidavit of intent to resume residence in the Philippines, to vote for elective positions in the national level: President; Vice-President; Senators; and Party-List Representatives



## Registration


Preliminary to the voting exercise is the registration of voters. During the registration process, the qualified voter accomplishes and files a sworn application for registration before the election officer of the city or municipality wherein he resides and including the same in the book of registered voters upon approval by the Election Registration Board. This process is currently guided by RA 8189 or the Continuing Votersâ€™ Registration Act of 1996.


The Overseas Absentee Voting (OAV) Law applies the mechanics in RA 8189 of personal registration either with the Election Board of Inspectors in their place of residence before their departure or with the representative of the Commission in the Philippine embassies, consulates and other foreign service establishment in their temporary residence overseas.


## Election Day


After undergoing the registration process and during election day, the voter proceeds to the casting of votes, which is conducted by the Board of Election Inspectors (BEI). All voters whose name appears in the list of voters will be allowed to vote. Official candidates and registered political parties and party-list groups are represented in the precincts by watchers.

Public counting of votes starts immediately after the close of voting at 3:00 p.m. Votes for candidates, simultaneously with the reading, are entered in the tally board and the election returns. Official watchers shall be permitted full access to the proceedings, but only the members of the BEI can write or place marks on the tally board and on the election returns. All questions on appreciation of ballots are decided by BEI by majority votes.


After all ballots have been read and recorded, the BEI signs and thumbmarks the election returns and lets the principal watchers of six major political parties do the same. Six copies of the election returns are placed inside corresponding envelopes, sealed and submitted to officials concerned. These returns are then distributed to the Comelec, to designated canvassers, and candidates/parties through their watchers and are then used for canvassing of votes.
