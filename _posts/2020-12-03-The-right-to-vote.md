It’s been already a decade and yet we still lack whom to vote for. We have the largest count of people but when it comes to voting half of the people are registered. 

### Why voting is important? 

Voting is a responsibility of citizens. It is a very important part of any democracy.  By voting citizens participate in the democratic process. Citizens vote for the leaders to represent them and guide them as a whole. Voting is our way to chance to stand up for the issues that we care about like public transportation, wages, and more. Our life depends on who will we vote for.

Take time to know the person who will we vote for. Our power is in our vote. We pay taxes and we don’t know how that money is being used.  Voting is our chance to choose how to taxes are spent. Voting is an opportunity to change, support the candidates whom you are in favor of that can help our community, state, and even our nation. 


The community depends on our hands. Make a decision that you won’t regret in the end. 

**Vote wisely**.
